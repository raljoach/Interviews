/* http://www.careercup.com/question?id=4681660918398976
 * Given a large network of computers, each keeping log files of visited urls, 
 * find the top ten of the most visited urls. 
(i.e. have many large <string (url) -> int (visits)> maps, 
calculate implicitly <string (url) -> int (sum of visits among all distributed maps), 
and get the top ten in the combined map) 

The result list must be exact, and the maps are too large to transmit over the network 
(especially sending all of them to a central server or using MapReduce directly, is not allowed)
