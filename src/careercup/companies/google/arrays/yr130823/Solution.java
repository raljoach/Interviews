 * Give you an array which has n integers,it has both positive and negative integers.Now you need sort this array in
 * a special way.After that,the negative integers should in the front,and the positive integers should in the back.
 * Also the relative position should not be changed. 
   eg. -1 1 3 -2 2 ans: -1 -2 1 3 2. 
   o(n)time complexity and o(1) space complexity is perfect.
