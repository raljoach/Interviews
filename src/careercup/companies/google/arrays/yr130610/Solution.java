/* http://www.careercup.com/question?id=19286747
 * Given an array of integers. Find two disjoint contiguous sub-arrays such that the absolute difference between the 
 * sum of two sub-array is maximum. 
* The sub-arrays should not overlap. 

eg- [2 -1 -2 1 -4 2 8] ans - (-1 -2 1 -4) (2 8), diff = 16 

I gave him o(n^2) algorithm but he was not satisfied.
