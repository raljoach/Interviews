 * we will name a number "aggregated number" if this number has the following attribute: 
    just like the Fibonacci numbers 
    1,1,2,3,5,8,13..... 
    
    the digits in the number can divided into several parts, and the later part is the sum of the former parts. 
    
    like 112358, because 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8 
    122436, because 12+24=36 
    1299111210, because 12+99=111, 99+111=210 
    112112224, because 112+112=224 
    so can you provide a function to check whether this number is aggregated number or not?
