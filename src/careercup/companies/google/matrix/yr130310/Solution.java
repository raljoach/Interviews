 * Given a 2-D matrix represents the room, obstacle and guard like the following (0 is room, B->obstacle, G-> Guard): 
    0 0 0 
    B G G 
    B 0 0 
    
    calculate the steps from a room to nearest Guard and set the matrix, like this 
    2 1 1 
    B G G 
    B 1 1 
    Write the algorithm, with optimal solution.
